# Security Features

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Authentication
- Users authenticate with email/password
- Server generates a JWT token with a 7-day expiration
- Token is stored in localStorage on the client
- All protected API requests include the token in the Authorization header

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 10 salt rounds
- Plain text passwords are never stored in the database
- Minimum password length is enforced (6 characters)

## File Security

### File Upload Validation
- Only PDF and MP4 files are allowed
- Maximum file size is limited to 20MB
- Files are stored in a dedicated [uploads/](file:///c:/Users/Azad/Desktop/SECURE%20WEBAPP/uploads) directory
- Original filenames are sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks

### Access Control
- Files can be marked as "public" or "private"
- Public files appear in the Downloads page and can be accessed by anyone
- Private files can only be accessed by:
  1. The owner of the file
  2. Anyone with the direct download link (shareable link)

### Shareable Link Mechanism
- Each file has a unique ID generated by MongoDB
- The download endpoint `/api/files/:id/download` handles access control
- For private files, the system checks if:
  1. The user is authenticated and is the owner, OR
  2. The user has the direct link (no ownership check for direct link access)
- This allows users to share private files by sharing the direct link without making them public

## Data Protection

### Database Security
- User passwords are never stored in plain text
- API responses exclude sensitive user information (passwords, etc.)
- File paths in the database do not expose server directory structure

### Frontend Security
- Input validation on all forms
- Client-side feedback for errors
- Automatic token management
- Secure storage of authentication tokens in localStorage
